# Genie
### The high-performance high-productivity Julia web framework

Genie is a full-stack MVC web framework that provides a streamlined and efficient workflow for developing modern web applications. It builds on Julia's strengths (high-level, high-performance, dynamic, JIT compiled), exposing a rich API and a series of tools for productive web development.

## Quick start
In a Julia session clone `Genie` and its dependencies (it's not yet an official package):
```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/essenciary/Flax.jl") # Genie's templating engine

julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/essenciary/SearchLight.jl") # Genie's ORM

julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/essenciary/Genie.jl") # Finally the Genie itself ðŸ‘»
```

Bring it into scope:
```julia
julia> using Genie
```

Create a new app:
```julia
julia> Genie.REPL.new_app("demo_app")
info: Done! New app created at /demo_app
```

`cd` into the new app's dir and start the server:
```
$> ./genie.jl s
```

See it in action by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/` with your favorite browser.

---

In order to start a Genie interactive session, load the app into the Julia REPL:
```
$> julia -L genie.jl --color=yes --depwarn=no -q
```

Alternatively, from a regular Julia session, you can just
```julia
julia> include("genie.jl")
```

Once the app is loaded you can start the web server anytime with
```julia
julia> AppServer.startup()
```

## Acknowledgements
* The amazing Genie logo was designed by my friend Alvaro Casanova (www.yeahstyledg.com).
* Genie uses a multitude of packages that have been contributed by so many incredible developers.
* I wouldn't have made it so far without the help and the patience of the amazing people at the `julia-users` group.

Thank you all.
